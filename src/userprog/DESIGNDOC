               ARGUMENT PASSING

Argument list element holds the argument, its length and its location
on a stack:
struct arg_elem
{
  char* argument;         /* Argument */
  int length;             /* Length of argument (including \0) */
  char* location;         /* Location on stack */
  struct list_elem elem;  /* list_elem */
};

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

To begin with we loop through the command line tokenising it one word at a time placing each argument into the arguments list in backwards order by pushing them to the front of the list in the order they are tokenised. During this loop we also count the total number of args.

Next we push the actual arguments onto the stack in arguments' list order, which is now effectively backwards or in other words right-to-left on the command line as expected. As each argument is actually pushed onto the stack, a pointer to its location now on the stack is also saved in the list in *location.

Word alignment and push arg[max] are pushed onto the stack ???

One last loop is performed through the list to push the location pointers onto the stack once again in list order again hence right-to-left on the command line.

Finally we push a pointer to last pointer, ie. argv, the total number of args, ie. argc, and a fake return address with just 0s???

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

The main difference between strtok() and strtok_r() is that strtok_r() stores the pointer of the index into a string which it last tokenised wheareas strtok() does not. Since The function strtok_r() is mainly given to us for tokenising the command line in Pintos which can have several arguments and needs tokenising several times, it is more useful to be able to have the added functionality from strtok_r().

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name

One advantage of the Unix approach is that the shell can pre-process arguments like * and expand the arguments to what they actually are in the filesystem so that the kernel only has to deal with actual arguments.

A second advantage is that in Unix less work is done in kernel space, since splitting a string does not require any kernel privileges it can be done in user space, after all the the more work done in user space the better.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

User programs' threads belong to processes now, which have their own struct as below.
struct process
{
  char* command;                  /* Command for use when loading process/thread */
  bool load_success;              /* Used with load_complete */
  struct semaphore load_complete; /* Ensures load is complete before process_execute() finishes */
  int exit_status;                /* Process exit status initialised to EXIT_FAILURE */
  struct semaphore exit_complete; /* Used in process_wait() */
  pid_t pid;                      /* Process pid */
  struct list_elem child_elem;    /* So it can be made a child of another processes thread*/
  struct list open_files;         /* List of files the process has open */
  int next_fd;                    /* Used for generating file descriptors*/
  struct file* process_file;      /* The filename of the process's executable */
};


User program threads now have a pointer to the process they belong to and a list of their children processes.
struct thread
{
...
#ifdef USERPROG
    struct process* process;      /* This thread's associated process */
    struct list children;         /* This thread's child _processes_ */
#endif
...
};


File structs now have an associated fd and are in file.h so that processes can access them and add them to the open_files list with the new list_elem.
struct file 
{
...
  int fd;                         /* File descriptor */
  struct list_elem elem;          /* For making a list of files in struct process */
};


>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

Each process has an associated list of open files beginning with the file descriptor 2 (as 1 is reserved for console writes), which gets a new struct file added to it each time a syscall_open() is called, with its fd set as the process->next_fd which is then incremented itself. Therefore there is no universal list of open files with the same fd for each file, but rather individual open files lists for each process, this ensures that a process cannot use or  modify another process's open files without first opening them itself.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

syscall_read() firstly checks the pointer safety of the buffer. Next it checks if fd == 0 and if so it will read in from the console using input_getc() until size chars have been read in. Otherwise, it will use find_file() to get the file corresponding to the file descriptor number passed in from the processes open_files list and check whether this is NULL, which it will be if the file descriptor does not exist for this process. If its NULL it returns a -1 error status to the thread's eax, otherwise it will acquire the filesystem lock, read from the file then release the lock, returning the number of bytes read.

syscall_write() once again checks the pointer safety of the buffer. It then checks whether the file descriptor is 1, if so it will try writing to console MAXCHAR bytes at a time where MAXCHAR is defined as 512 bytes. Otherwise, it will use find_file() to get the file corresponding to the file descriptor number passed in from the processes open_files list and check whether this is NULL. If its NULL it returns a -1 error status like in syscall_read() otherwise, it acquires the filesystem lock, writes to the file then releases the locks and returns the number of bytes written, like in syscall_read().

syscall_wait() calls process_wait() on the process given.

process_wait() iterates through the list of child threads in order to find the tid_t of the child which matches the one handed in. When it finds the correct child, it performs a sema_down() on the childs exit_complete semaphore in order to wait for it to exit. When the child exits, the child will perform a sema_up() on its own exit_complete signalling to the parent process to continue with the method.

The parent process will then proceed to remove the child from its list of children and free up its childs memory. Finally it returns from this function with the child's exit_status.

In order to not obscure the primary function of system call code, pointers are checked if they are safe through the check_safe_ptr() function call in the syscall_handler() before an individual syscall is even called.  The check_safe_ptr() function takes the interrupt_frame esp and checks the number of args the syscall will require are valid through using in a loop stopping at i > number of args. 

For each pointer check_safe_ptr() will call is_safe_ptr() which has been written in pagedir.c and as the spec suggests checks that the pointer passed in is not NULL, over PHYSBASE or pointing to memory which has not been allocated yet.

To ensure that allocated resources are freed, if the is_safe_ptr() returns false, then the process is killed with thread_exit() which then frees up all the resources used and closes all the open files (as thread_exit() also calls process_exit() which does this).

For those syscalls which use a buffer such as syscall_write(), we have written a function called check_buffer_safety() which is called at the start of these syscalls. This method checks firstly that the buffer pointer is safe then that the last place which the pointer can point too is safe ie. buffer + size. If this fails it will then call thread_exit(). However, it also checks if a buffer is large enough that at each interval of PGSIZE this pointer is safe as it may be pointing to a page which is not allocated in memory, as virtual memory allocation is not continuous. ?


An example would be a standard call from a thread to write to a file or to the console:

First of all the syscall_handler is called and it checks the syscall number which in this case would be SYS_WRITE, and selects the correct case using the switch statement. As sycall_write() requires 3 arguments check_safe_ptr() would be called with the interrupt frame's esp and the parameter 3. It will then check esp, esp+4, esp+8 and esp+12 for pointer safety and assuming that all the pointers are safe it would return without killing the thread. 

Next the syscall_write() method would be called with all the arguments taken from their correct places on the stack and the first thing syscall_write() would do is call check_buffer_safety() with the buffer pointer and size of the amount of text expected to write passed in. This would then check as mentioned above the safety of the first pointer of the buffer, the last pointer and the safety at each PGSIZE location into the buffer. Finally the function call would perform the rest of the code as syscall_write() is expected to and return by placing the number of bytes actually written in the interrupt frames' eax.


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

syscall_exec() calls process_execute(), which after initialising the process performs a sema_down() on its load_complete semaphore. Once the new thread has been scheduled and completed its load() method it performs a sema_up() on this semaphore, ensuring that the parent process cannot return before the child process has finished loading.

A check is then performed to ensure that the new processes load has actually returned correctly, if not the function returns with the EXIT_FAILURE status, otherwise it will return the child processes' thread tid.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

Processes have an exit_complete semaphore which is downed in a process_wait() call on a child process, this semaphore is itself upped when a process_exit() call is performed. In a process_execute() when a child process is initialised this semaphore is initialised to 0. 

This means that if a process waits on a child it will perform a sema_down() on exit_complete and only return from that wait when the child itself exits and performs a sema_up() because initially it will be set to 0. If inversly the child process exits before the a process_wait() on it is called then its exit_complete semaphore will be set to 1, so the sema_down() will mean that it will not have to wait on the child process and be able to just carry on with freeing the childs memory. By using a semaphore we avoid all possible synchronisation and race conditions.

We ensure that all of a dead processes rescources are freed by making all parent processes process_wait() on their children when they themselves call process_exit() and in turn free up their childs memory once it returns. This means that dead processes may hang around longer than necessary but it saves us from having a global list of processes and iterating through the whole list every so often checking if these processes are dead in order to free their memory. It also means that we have no issues with child processes dying after their parents and having no one to free their memory.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

Before every time we dereference a pointer to user memory we check its safe using is_safe_ptr(), which follows the conditions stated in the spec to guarantee a pointer is safe. Then just dereference it, accessing all user memory from addresses returned from the interrupt_frame. We chose this method because it was the simplest one, allowing us to safely assume that when the is_safe_ptr() method returns true, that address is safe to access.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Each process has a list of file_descriptors. The clear disadvantage of this is that space is wasted as if there was only one universal list then less memory would be wasted with extra and unnecessary pointers.

However, there is an advantage to this method as its easier to just allocate an fd to a file as its needed rather than allocating an fd to all files at the start before any process is even started. Also a rogue process will not be able just write or read to a file with a randomly passed in fd if it has not yet opened the file.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We used the default identity mapping, as we believed it to be neat and easy to implement since in Pintos each user process has only one thread. If Pintos were to implement multi-threaded processes, we would need to change the mapping from one-to-one to many tid_t to one pid_t.

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems

They were all fairly hard, although altogether it took less time and was probably less difficult than task 1.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave

None of the guidance we received was misleading.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining tasks?

We did not ask for any help from the TAs, other than a question on blackboard about how to correctly "push" to a new process's stack and what address to use, which was in itself quite a useful tool to have at our disposal.

>> Any other comments?

No.
